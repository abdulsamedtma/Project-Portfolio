# Code Refactor Starter Code
## Description
Building a portfolio of my work to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Applying the core skills recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS Variables. Although I do not have enough web applications to showcase at this point but will keep adding more projects in the near future.

Web **accessibility** is an increasingly important consideration for businesses since it ensures that individuals with disabilities may use a website using assistive technologies such as screen readers, braille keyboards, and so on.
It also assists the company in avoiding lawsuits that may occur if persons with impairments are unable to access the website. 

**Motivated** by my penchant for a successful career in software engineering, honing my HTML and advanced CSS skills as a full-stack development student will lay the strong resilient foundation for my growth and success in the industry. Every day is a learning day!

This resource will be helpful to students/beginners learning the basics of Software development ie Advance CSS. I have gained lots of experience such Flexbox, media queries CSS Variables as I was working on this project.
